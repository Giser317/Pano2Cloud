# Feature Extraction with LightGlue

This stage uses [LightGlue](https://github.com/cvg/LightGlue) to extract reliable feature correspondences between image pairs.

Please follow the installation and usage instructions in the official repository.  

Once feature correspondences are extracted, they can be passed into `forward_intersection.py` for triangulation.
